[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
The Demon King killed my family[N]
and took over my country![AN]
To get to him I need[N]
to go through you![A][X]

##Ch3Start
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
That village looks nice.[N]
Those horses don't.[AN]
[MidRight]
And one of those horses[N]
is looking fancy.[AN]
LEEROY...[A][X]

##Ch3SecondScene
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x33][0x1]
Hehehe...[A]
I see Void's army![N]
Time to earn some gold![AN]
I also have a horseslayer.[N]
Leeroy is gonna be history![AN]
I, Jenkins, will strike[N]
him down![A][X]

##GettingJay
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0xF][0x1]
What's all this racket?[N]
I can't compile my project.[AN]
I've still got some research[N]
on this fair tale's graphic[AN]
compression format, plus I still[N]
need Boo's script. Who are you?[AN]
You're fighting against the Demon[N]
King? Maybe I'll run into my[AN]
man on the way. Name's Jay,[N]
by the way. Fear my Continue![A][X]

##Ch3Ending
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x14][0x1]
Idiotic Jenkins. I, Leeroy,[N]
am the only person able to[AN]
charge in without care![N]
Your weapon is now mine.[AN]
[MidRight]
You should be more careful.[N]
Horseslayers, knight killers,[AN]
ridersbanes, beast killers,[N]
halberds, poleaxes, and more[AN]
cause lots of trouble for you.[N]
No matter. Onwards we go![A][X]

##Ch8Start1
[MidLeft][LoadPrine]
Okay, let's try one more time...[AN]
[CloseEyes][Beat] [Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]Blast! Why can't I use this[N]
Knight's Crest? I'm clearly qualified![AN]
Whatever, maybe it'll work someday.[AN]
[Beat] Is that soldiers I hear?[N]
Ugh, oh no...[A][X]

##Ch8Start2
[MidLeft][LoadVoid]
[MidRight][LoadPrine]
Hey! You guys don't look like[N]
the soldiers trying to kill me.[AN]
Think you could help me out a bit[N]
here? Though I'd like to think[AN]
that I could hold my own...[A]
[MidLeft]
Of course. These soldiers are[N]
in my way anyway. Disposing of[AN]
them is only natural.[AN]
Everyone, get ready![A][X]

##Ch8Left
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
Whoa, whoa, don't point[N]
that weapon at me![AN]
Okay, okay, I'll give you[N]
something nice, so just[AN]
leave me alone, will you?[A][X]

##Ch8Right
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5B][0x01]
Aw man, did you mess up my garden[N]
on your way in here?[AN]
I spent so much time making[N]
it look nice too...[AN]
Well, I guess I won't need[N]
this anymore. I was going to[AN]
use it as an ornament...[A][X]

##Ch9VillageText
[MidLeft][LoadCurrent]
Oh cool, I found a thing.[A][X]

##EdgeJoins
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x13][0x1]
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
I can see you have[N]
a tragic backstory.[A]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]I don't want to talk about it.[A][X]

##Ch10PreBattleText1
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Hold! There are enemies nearby.[AN]
They want to impede our progress.[AN]
We will show them what our[N]
army is made of.[AN]
Form up and prepare to advance![A][X]

##Ch10PostBattleText1
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Phew. That was a tough battle.[N]
But we got through it all the same.[AN]
Alright everyone, it's time to go.[N]
The Demon King won't slay himself![AN]
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x16][0x1]
You're going to slay the Demon King?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Samson? Ah, yes. That is the plan.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I see. In that case, allow me to join[N]
you and add my bow to this cause.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You would help us? Really?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Of course. I hate the Demon King[N]
as much as you do. I wish to have[AN]
a hand in bringing about his end.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, I don't see why not.[N]
Welcome aboard, Samson![A][X]

##Ch10House1Text
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5E][0x1]
That Samson fellow means well,[N]
but he got confused and is with[AN]
the Donateenaries. You might be[N]
able to get him to stand down.[A][X]

##Ch10House2Text
[Right][LoadCurrent]
Seems like nobody's home.[A][X]

##SamsonRecText
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x16][0x1]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hey! Are you fighting those[N]
people too?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Who asks?[A] Wait, that's not[N]
important right now.[A] You're clearly[N]
not one of those people.[AN]
I will fight alongside you for[N]
this battle.[A][X]

##Arve_Event
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x18][0x01]
The Travel System will pull any enemies[N]
from the throne room's gold tiles to the[A][N]
main battleground, so make sure to check[N]
out the threats that are up there too![A][X]

##Ch12RecruitTalk
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadTye]
Hey, you there! Do you know[N]
know Tim and Tam? I hate them.[AN]
I am their archenemy! And some[N]
day, I will prove myself the[AN]
strongest armour knight there[N]
is in the world! What fools they[AN]
are to become fighters. And I[N]
thought Tam was going to be a[AN]
shaman and Timathan something[N]
interesting, but no. Boring[AN]
fighters. Allow me to travel[N]
with you, so I can one-up them.[AN][X]

##Ch13VillageText
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
There used to be treasure in[N]
this here desert.[AN]
People came to this village[N]
searching for a fortune.[AN]
But I came too late, and[N]
now there's nothing left.[AN]
All I found were these[N]
stupid old boots![AN]
Forget this! I'm going home.[A][X]

##Ch14TalkEvent
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadEevster]
I am Eevster, the King of the Basement![AN]
Or, I was. I got dethroned by that[N]
Carlyle fool. Some loyal Basement men[AN]
are fighting with me, but the rest of[N]
those soldiers are traitors to the realm.[AN]
Help me reclaim control of the Basement,[N]
and I might help you out down the line.[A][X]

##Ch16NikitaAppears
[MidLeft][LoadVoid]
[MidRight][LoadNikita]
I'm Nikita. Don't get me mixed[N]
up with that impostor there.[AN]
Also there are enemies[N]
approaching from the south.[A][X]

##KagaJoins
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x23][0x1]
MAEDA! I have found you at last![N]
Now pay for what you did to my series![A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x48][0x1]
What I did?[N]
I SAVED your pathetic series![AN]
I gave the people what they[N]
wanted, nay, NEEDED![A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x23][0x1]
Maybe you did,[N]
but at what cost?[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x48][0x1]
Is that including[N]
DLC and amiibos?[A]
[ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x23][0x1]
RRRRAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH!!![A][X]


##KagaMaeda
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x23][0x01]

##RecruitJakeTalk
[MidLeft][LoadJake]
I'm Jake, Anna's husband and[N]
reclassing pioneer. What?[AN]
You have three Annas in your[N]
army? Then you will be able[AN]
to perform the legendary...[N]
[Red]Triangle Attack!![Red][A][X]

##Ch21Start
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Hmm, that girl...[A][NL]
She doesn't look like she's[NL]
in my way. Maybe I shouldn't[AN]
kill her.[A][X]

##Ch21End
[MidRight][LoadDoot]
Thanks for saving me![A][NL]
I owe you a lot, so I guess[NL]
I'll help you with whatever[A][NL]
it is you're trying to do.[A][X]

##Ch24RecruitEvilFlorina

[MidLeft][LoadFlorina]
[Invert]
You there![N]
You look like you can fight.[AN]
That Gwendolyn's gone insane,[N]
she thinks she's a GOOD unit.[AN]
Help me correct that delusion,[N]
and I'll help you in return.[A]
[CloseSpeechSlow][MidLeft][Invert][X]

##Ch24RecruitEvilFlorina2
[MidLeft][Invert]
10,000 Gold. What do you say?[N]
[Yes][Invert][X]

##Ch24FlorinaYes
[MidLeft][Invert]
I knew you'd see it my way.[AN]
As agreed, 10,000 Gold.[N]
Don't spend it all at once![A][Invert][X]

##Ch24FlorinaNo
[MidLeft][Invert]
What, not enough? Too bad.[N]
That's my final offer.[A][Invert][X]

##Ch24TopVill
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5C][0x01]
Everyone here has gone delusional.[N]
Gwendolyn the Great Knight? Pah![AN]
I remember her being Wendy the[N]
Useless Armour Knight! Someone[AN]
call Sophia in too, she'll want to[N]
see this mess unfold as well.[AN][X]

##Ch24LeftVill
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5D][0x01]
Apparently Gwendy has gathered[N]
an army of trainees. Do something[AN]
about it! Appearences can be very[N]
decieving; there's supers there![AN][X]

##Ch26Village1
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5E][0x01]
This place is named after one[N]
of Kaga's decendants, Darrman.[AN]
Legend has it he had five children[N]
for his five Fire Emblem games.[AN]
Darrman for Dark Dragon and the[N]
Sword of Light, the first game.[AN]
His alter ego, MCProductions, for[N]
Mystery of the Emblem, the third.[AN]
Bookofholsety, who caused waves[N]
in Genealogy of the Holy War.[AN]
Zane Avernanthy, a skeleton of[N]
the legendary Thracia 776.[AN]
However, the child of the oft[N]
forgotten Gaiden has taken after[AN]
the game and has been lost to[N]
time. Who could she even be?[A][X]

##Ch26Village2
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x5F][0x01]
Using notes from a Jugdralian hero,[N]
Darrman then opened the first game's[AN]
internals for the world to see. He[N]
even discovered forgotten discussions[AN]
about random things, and constructed[N]
a brand new chapter. He worked with[AN]
the other descendants of Kaga in his[N]
endeavours, and he even stepped out[N]
to translate modifications in other[AN]
games. Recently, he left in order to[N]
progress through "Fire Emblem Purgatory",[N]
along with a girl called Lin. Now I[AN]
don't know about you, but there's[N]
something about her that reminds me[AN]
of... Oh, I'm sorry for rambling for[N]
so long. Take this as an apology.[AN][X]

##Ch26Village3
[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x61][0x01]
The Donateenaries have trashed[N]
the neighbourhood and are doing[AN]
things that would make the boss[N]
really, really annoyed. Stuff like[AN]
renaming the castle the Central[N]
Evil Domain. Come on, can't they[AN]
at least pretend to act like good[N]
people, instead of scum?[A][X]

##Ch29IntroHelp
The goddess of vengeance[N]
lent your army her [Red]blessing[Red].[AN]

were not in vain.[A][X]

[MidLeft]
This is it. Our final battle![AN]

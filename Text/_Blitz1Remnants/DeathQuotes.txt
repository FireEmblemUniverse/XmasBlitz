So you've all arrived here in[N]
my castle. Before I strike[AN]
you down, I shall tell you a[N]
story. After I exiled Kaga,[AN]
I rose up the ranks and became[N]
the director of Fire Emblem.[AN]
The series is printing money,[N]
as Kusakihara and I can prove.[AN]
Yes, you may detest Tharja and[N]
Peri, and you may be sickened[AN]
by Camilla's sheer fanservice.[N]
But the series would have died[AN]
otherwise! Do you really think[N]
that would be the right thing[AN]
to do? ...You'd rather Fire[N]
Emblem have died with "dignity"[AN]
instead of bringing in success?[N]
Very well. En garde![AN][X]

## MaedaDeath

scorned. But now I am strong.[AN]
You can become strong too,[N]

long road, but it's possible.[AN]

I wanted to conquer you, you[N]
Nintenlord-loving scum![AN][X]

## LyonVsVoid
[OpenMidLeft][Load][0x4A][0x01]
So you finally made it. Void,[N]
princess of a realm whose[AN]
name was stolen. Descendant of[N]
your holy Babby, and wielder of[AN]
the Super Blitz. You've come[N]
here seeking revenge, to stop[AN]

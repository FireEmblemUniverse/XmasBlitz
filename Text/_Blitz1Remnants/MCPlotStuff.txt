## PrologueEnding
[Right][LoadVoid]
[Left][LoadLeeroy]
[Right]
Alright. Now that those mooks are dealt[N]
with, let us kill the Demon King.[AN]
[Left]
No, Void. There's still[N]
29 chapters of mooks to go.[AN]
[Right]
WHAT?! I want to kill[N]
the Demon King now.[A]
[Left]
Unfortunately, that is presently[N]
not possible. When the Demon King[AN]
killed your father, he took the only[N]
weapon able to kill him, the Super[AN]
Blitz. I hazard a guess it'll take[N]
roughly a full fan hack to re-obtain[AN]
it so we can actually kill the Demon King.[AN]
[Right]
Leeroy, sometimes I hate you.[A]
[Left]
It's part of the job, Void.[A][X]

## Ch1WithoutMember
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadMyrmAnna]
I'd love to help you, but one[N]
of my sisters left something[AN]
very important in the nest of[N]
a terrifying Draco Zombie...[AN]
or are they Necro Dragons now?[N]
Besides, I'm a [Red]Secret Unit.[Red][AN]
Regardless, help me out,[N]
and I can help you out.[AN][X]

## RecruitingMyrmAnna
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadMyrmAnna]
MY CARD! Thank you for retrieving[N]
it for me. Now I'll just take that[AN]
card from you[Beat] I'm Anna. Some[N]
like to call me the Secret Seller,[AN]
and you should know we traders[N]
make some VERY deep cuts.[A][X]

## Ch1Ending
[Left][LoadBreguet]
[Right][LoadVoid]
Well, uh, that is something, kid.[A]
[Left]
You needed a road.[N]
I gave you one.[A]
[Right]
Fair enough.[A][X]

## Ch2Opening
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
[OpenLeft][LoadBede]
Excuse me miss.[A]
[Right]
Who are you? If you stay in[N]
my way, then prepare to pay.[A]
[Left]
I am Bede, a handsome curate.[N]
I cannot fight, and because of this[AN]
I cannot defeat the Brigands in the[N]
fort to the south. Please help me.[AN]
[Right]
Only if you work for me afterwards.[A]
[Left]
Deal.[A][X]

## Ch2VillageConvo1
[Right][LoadCurrent]
Hey, look! A thing![A][X]

## Ch2ArchRant
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadArch]
Back in my day, we weren't making[N]
hacks super lightning fast. No. We[N]
made hacks with time, effort, and[N]
many, many delays. So what if our[N]
hacks never finished? So what if[N]
Elibean Nights is still in hiatus?[N]
When that famous date of 2020 finally[N]
arrives, and Elibean Nights finally[N]
releases, it'll be something of[N]
value, not something made on the[N]
cheap. What, are we Maeda now,[N]
getting things out fast as possible[N]
to make a quick buck? No! I refuse[N]
to accept it. Hacks and Fire Emblem [N]
used to have dignity and honor, but no,[N]
now that we are fucking mainstream,[N]
we've got goddamn quotas to meet.[N]
Why does everyone go sorry with age?[N]
I remember the good old days before[N]
the Maeda attacked. Sure, our group[N]
was much smaller, but we had heart,[N]
dreams, and soul, and by God we-[AN]
[Right]
SHUT UP![A]
[Left]
AHHH! Someone's here![A]
[Clear]
[Right]
Hey, he dropped something.[A][X]

## Ch2Ending
[Left][LoadBede]
[Right][LoadVoid]
Well, that was easy.[A]
[Left]
Thank you, Void. As thanks,[N]
I will serve as your advisor and[AN]
as a healer from now on.[A]
[Right]
Cool; let's go.[A][X]

## Ch4Opening
[Left][LoadLeeroy]
[Right][LoadVoid]
Who are those men guarding that castle?[A]
[Left]
The Donateenries ma'am, an[N]
evil cult who revived the[AN]
Demon King by donating to the[N]
Feditor God, Hex. They say even[AN]
now they seek someone with[N]
Major Hex Holy Blood to[AN]
revive their unholy God.[AN]
[Right]
They revived the Demon King...[N]
The Demon King killed my family,[AN]
and they WANT that monster to[N]
return to this world. What possible--[AN]
[Left]
They are generic anime villains ma'am,[N]
they don't have a reason to do so.[AN]
[Right]
...We're not in a good story, are we?[AN]
[Left]
Quantity over Quality.[AN][X]

## Ch4NotArchRecruitment
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadArch]
I heard this hack needed a good[N]
mage. Well, my Divine Lightning[AN]
pierces the skies, and I'm happy[N]
to help. Why are you staring at[AN]
me? You're expecting me to rant? I[N]
don't know what you're talking about![A][X]

## Ch4Ending
[Right][LoadVoid]
That was the power of the Donateenaries?[N]
Ha, what a joke. Alas, they were in my[AN]
way, so they had to pay.[AN][X]

## Ch5Opening
[Right][LoadVoid]
[Left][LoadLeeroy]
My lady! WE'VE GOT TROUBLE![A]
[Right]
What, Leeroy?[A]
[Left]
The Donateenaries want revenge[N]
and attacked, and what's worse,[AN]
we've been separated from the[N]
rest of our forces.[AN]
[Right]
Our only chance is to regroup[N]
and seize their base. Ready, MOVE![AN][X]

## RecruitingKirsten
[Right][LoadCurrent]
[Left][LoadKirsten]
I'm Kirsten, mate. The strongest[N]
pegasus knight in all the land![AN]
[Right]
Uh, I don't know about you, but[N]
one single pegasus knight attack-[AN]
[Left]
What's your problem? I'm gonna[N]
hop in, clean out the Fort of Bad,[AN]
and sit back and have a nice barbie![N]
Whaddya say? Those flaming gollahs[AN]
won't last very long. Easy peasy![AN]
[Right]
Well, it's dangerous for one girl[N]
to just run into a big scary fort.[AN]
[Left]
You're scared of who? Zonta? He's[N]
nothing, and neither is Saara![AN]
Now g'day, mate![AN][Clear]
[Right]
*sigh* What a handful.[A][X]

## Ch5Ending
[Left][LoadBede]
[FarLeft][LoadLeeroy]
[MidRight][LoadVoid]
That was... surprising.[A]
[FL]
Indeed, let us be more[N]
careful in the future.[AN]
[MR]
Right. But how did the Donateenaries[N]
change the weather, though?[AN]
[Left]
I assume it must be the unholy[N]
tome Naglfar, said to be the[AN]
by-product of some unholy demon[N]
known as FEditor, now known as[AN]
the Demon King. FEditor gave the[N]
tome of Naglfar to the unholy[AN]
bloodline of his evil god Hex[N]
in order to protect their followers.[AN]
[MR]
So the Demon King merely[N]
serves Hex then?[AN]
[Left]
Yes, the Demon King is more akin[N]
to an angel than a demon, an[AN]
eternal servant to the evil god.[N]
The very same god vanquished[AN]
by the great gods, the league of FEU.[AN]
[MR]
The league of FEU. My family[N]
told me about them before...[AN]
[Left]
Yes, the League of FEU. It is[N]
said you descend from one of[AN]
the League's Gods, and as such[N]
you can wield the fabled[AN]
Super Blitz Lance.[AN]
[MR]
The holy weapon of the League[N]
God Babby, the Super Blitz...[AN]
[Left]
Void, it is your duty to prevent the Demon[N]
King from reviving the Evil God Hex.[AN][X]

## Ch6Opening
[Right][LoadVoid]
[Left][LoadBede]
[Right]
What is this place?[A]
[Left]
This is the Fort of Bad, a simple stronghold,[N]
but a place more frightening than Hell[AN]
itself for the people living[N]
in the nearby Port of Bad.[AN]
[Right]
Why?[A]
[Left]
The Donateenaries occupy this fortress.[N]
I've heard tell they force the people[AN]
here to make massive donations to Hex.[N]
The town's nearly starved from this abuse.[A]
[Right]
That's... horrid. We must[N]
retake this fortress at once![A]
[Left]
Very well, I will give the order.[A][X]

## Ch6Ending
[Right][Load][0x01][0x01]
Having seized the Fort of Bad,[N]
Void decides to allow her troops[AN]
to rest in the Port of Bad.[N]
What dangers await her in the future?[A][X]

## Ch7Opening
[Right][LoadVoid]
The port is under attack, we must save it.[A][X]

## Ch7Ending
[Right][LoadVoid]
We did it, but we must get moving.[A][X]

## Ch8Ending
[Right][LoadVoid]
Well, those soldiers are no longer[N]
in the way. Onwards we go![A][X]

## Ch9Opening
[Left][LoadEdge]
Damn... The Donateenaries are getting[N]
close. I will never forgive them for[AN]
what they did to my family. Those[N]
dastards will pay the price for this![AN][X]

## Ch9Ending
[Right][LoadVoid]
[Left][LoadLeeroy]
With a tragic backstory, comes[N]
redemption for the past. Such[AN]
is the path of an edgy man.[A][X]

## Ch11Ending
[Left][LoadLeeroy]
[Right][LoadVoid]
It doesn't matter what tricks[N]
they try against me. If you're[AN]
in my way, you're going to pay![A]
[Left]
Still, us having our own Warp[N]
abilities would make this much easier.[A]
[Right]
True.[A][X]

## Ch12Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadSoldier]
[OpenRight][LoadGheb]
So the wittle princess wants[N]
to challenge me, does she? Maybe[AN]
I can provide her some[N]
"entertainment" for a while.[AN]
[Left]
Boss, watch your wording.[N]
This is why the bad jokes exist.[AN]
[Right]
What? How does that not come across as me[N]
wanting to play a game of cards with her?[AN]
[Left]
Apparently, it doesn't come across[N]
that way at all, seeing as they[AN]
have prepared weapons against us.[AN]
[Right]
Damnit.[AN][X]

## GhebDeath
[FarLeft][LoadGheb]
I just... wanted...[N]
to play... Yugioh...[A][X]

## Ch12Ending
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
Sorry Gheb, but you were in my way.[A][X]

## Ch13Opening
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
Oh great, a desert chapter. I hate deserts.[N]
Let's get out of here quickly.[A][X]

## Ch13Ending
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
Thank God that's over.[A][X]

## Ch14Opening
[Left][LoadLeeroy]
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
This text is a placeholder![A]
[Left]
Why are you saying that, my liege?[A]
[Right]
I don't know, but I did.[A]
[Left]
Regardless, we are approaching the[N]
Basement, a rather strange place.[AN]
I can't say I know much about it...[N]
Stuff about fookers and rage.[A][X]

## Ch14Ending
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
That text may have been a placeholder,[N]
but this victory sure wasn't.[AN][X]

## Ch16Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadLeeroy]
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
So this is Dead Valley.[A]
[Left]
I don't like it here, can we leave?[A]
[Right]
Come on, Leeroy. There's no reason to be[N]
afraid of a few dead things and things[AN]
that are about to be dead things.[AN]
[Left]
I just don't want us to BE those[N]
about to be dead things![AN]
[Right]
Hehehe.[A][X]

## Ch16Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadLeeroy]
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
You can stop hiding now, Leeroy.[N]
We're leaving the valley.[AN]
[Left]
Thank the gods![A]
[Right]
Oh no, the genericaning is[N]
spreading. We must find Kaga[AN]
before the Demon King kills us all.[AN]
[Clear]
[Left]
Who? What? Genericaning? Kaga?[N]
What in Babby's-WAIT! MY LIEGE!!![A][X]

## Ch17Opening
So Void and company advance deeper into[N]
Donateenary territory in search of the[AN]
mystical being known as Kaga, the creator[N]
of Fire Emblem. It is said amongst the[AN]
common people that Kaga disappeared one[N]
day leaving only his descendants to carry[AN]
on his legacy. Many claim he went to a[N]
paradise known as Vestaria, but no one[AN]
in the realm knows for sure...[AN][X]

## Ch17Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadLeeroy]
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
Victory is had. Let's go![A]
[Left]
That was anti-climatic.[A][X]

## Ch18Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadLeeroy]
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
Wow, look at these islands.[A]
[Left]
Pardon me, milady, but... why are some[N]
of those enemies nearly in the nude?[A]
[Right]
Who cares? They're in my way![A]
[Left]
Aptly put, my lady.[A][X]

## RecruitingEdgeworth
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
[OpenLeft][LoadEdgeworth]
I will join your party.[A]
[Right]
B-but-[A]
[Left]
OBJECTION! I have already joined.[A][X]

## Ch18Ending
[FarLeft][LoadBede]
[Left][LoadLeeroy]
[OpenMidRight][LoadVoid]
Those soldiers in dancer's attire[N]
certainly weren't Donateenaries...[AN]
[Left]
Indeed, I wonder who they are with?[AN]
[MR]
Good question, they seemed even[N]
angrier than the Donateenaries.[AN]
[FL]
I've been asking around lately, and[N]
I believe they are part of Maeda's[AN]
army. As I'm sure you know, Maeda[N]
attacked Kaga's homeland, Akaneia,[AN]
and forced him to flee the realm.[N]
Now he has built his castle and[AN]
is trying to destroy Fire Emblem[N]
and everything it stands for,[AN]
and destroy his holy bloodline[N]
while he's at it. He is not a[AN]
servant of Hex, but a man of his own[N]
will. We must save Akaneia from him![AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadKaga]
HELP![A]
[MR]
A call for help. Protagonist contract[N]
states I must answer that call for help.[AN]
ONWARD![A][X]

## Ch19Opening
[FL][LoadPlum]
[Left][LoadMeriah]
[OpenMidRight][LoadKaga]
Wait, please stop![A]
[FL]
No.[A]
[Clear]
[Left]
We were made to suffer because of you,[N]
and your precious "TearRing Saga"![A]
[Clear]
[Left][LoadLyria]
[FL][LoadYuni]
Really, what kind of sick bastard makes[N]
the player sell a character into slavery[AN]
to unlock a certain unit type?! A crazy[N]
lunatic with a bondage fetish, that's who![AN]
[Left]
It's time that I sang- I mean, gave[N]
you a taste of your own medicine!![AN][X]

## RecruitingSigurd
[OpenLeft][LoadSigurd]
What, someone is in need of help?[N]
Allow my slightly, highly flammable[AN]
self to assist. What? I have bad[N]
experiences with fire spells, okay?[AN]
Being the main course at Alvis's[N]
Barhara BBQ isn't very fun.[AN][X]

## Ch19Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadLeeroy]
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
That man in dancer clothing,[N]
was that... Kaga?[A]
[Left]
So it would seem. It appears he has been[N]
cursed by those dancers we saw.[A]
[Right]
Maeda's men were fierce, and they[N]
were determined to stop him somehow.[AN]
Why was he transformed into a dancer?[N]
That one woman leading them. She had[AN]
a face, so she must be important.[A]
[Left]
Mmm... We must be careful. After all,[N]
we still need Kaga's help. We cannot[AN]
let him perish in this state![A]
[Right]
Indeed, let's go![A][X]

## Ch20Opening
[Left][LoadMaeda]
[Right][LoadPlum]
Master Maeda, I regret to inform you[N]
that Lady Meriah has fallen to an[AN]
unknown army. They seem to be led by-[A]
[Left]
I see... What about Kaga? Has he[N]
tasted his own medicine yet?[A]
[Right]
Of course.[A]
[Left]
Good. He raised me, but I must surpass him![N]
The best way to do this is use his own[AN]
creations against him. By amassing a horde[N]
of people broken by his creations, real[AN]
and in his games, I will triumph.[A][X]

## Ch20Ending
[Left][LoadKaga]
[Right][LoadVoid]
Kaga, we finally found you![A]
[Left]
Who are you, and why were[N]
you also looking for me?[AN]
[Right]
Well, I needed your help for... something.[A]
[Left]
You don't remember?[A]
[Right]
Apparently not. Good to know[N]
this whole quest was filler![A]
[Left]
I doubt that. Something tells me some[N]
other semi related game just got a[AN]
major plot point resolved right now![A]
[Right]
But I don't appear in that game.[N]
I appear in this game.[A]
[Left]
Who cares? Vestaria taught[N]
me QUANTITY OVER QUALITY.[A]
[Right]
Could you accompany me and[N]
teach me your ways?[A]
[Left]
Sure, why not?[A][X]

## Ch21Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadTatara]
Hoho... You fools hope to[N]
beat me, Lord Tatara?[AN]
Dyute! Kill those idiots[N]
with your Aura![A][X]

## Ch22Opening
So Void had finally recruited Kaga in an[N]
arc that some would define as being as[N]
fillerific as the Valm Arc in Awakening,[AN]
she now returns to trying to obtain[N]
revenge against the Demon King.[AN]
Taking a boat, she approaches the[N]
homeland of the Donateenaries.[A][X]

## Ch22Ending
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
SOON, we will finish this journey.
[Left][LoadCelica]
Ah...[A]
[Right]
I thought I had killed you. Return[N]
to whence you've came!![AN]
[Left]
Wait, I'm not evil any more![AN]
This is a message from Lady Mila.[N]
"Trust in Falchion".[AN]
I don't know what it means, but[N]
they say that only death can break[AN]
the hold of the Demon King Hextator.[N]
Now that I am free, I can join you.[AN]
[Right]
...Alright. But I'll have my men[N]
keep a close eye on you. Your name?[A]
[Left]
...Celica. May Mila's blessings[N]
be upon you...[A][X]

## Ch23Opening
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
Ugh, all these boats make me sick.[N]
And now there's a whole fleet of 'em![A]
[Left][LoadMrBones]
RATTLE RATTLE![N]
You are intruding on the skeleton[N]
colony! I hate fleshy beings. And[AN]
what's more fleshy than a zombie?[N]
A human! A whole boat of them![AN]
You all make me sick and nauseous.[N]
I am Mr. Bones, the governor of the[AN]
skeleton colony, and I will knock[N]
you all down, into the sea![A][X]

## Ch23Ending
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
Spooky scary skeletons. At least[N]
we're drawing in to port now.[A][X]

## Ch24Opening
[OpenLeft][LoadKaga]
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
People are in our way.[A]
[Left]
We're going to change that?[A]
[Right]
Indeed.[A][X]

## Ch24Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadKaga]
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
We won. So how many more chapters[N]
do we have to go until we're done?[AN]
[Left]
If you're tired of this, imagine[N]
the player. They're sick of it.[AN]
[Right]
Hey, they made it this far. We just[N]
need to kill the Donateenaries and[AN]
the Demon King, right? Why does that[N]
need 31 chapters of gameplay?[AN]
[Left]
QUANTITY!!![A][X]

## Ch25Opening
And so Void continues her journey,[N]
unaware that the Donateenaries have[AN]
set a trap for her involving her most[N]
hated thing: bananas.[AN][X]

## Ch25Ending
[OpenLeft][LoadLeeroy]
[OpenRight][LoadVoid]
That was terrifying.[A]
[Left]
Come on, Void. Our journey[N]
is not yet finished.[A]
[Right]
Very true. Let's go, Leeroy.[AN]
[Left][Clear][Right]
Show no fear to the bananas,[N]
Void. They're more afraid of[AN]
you than you are them.[A][X]

## Ch26Opening
This is truly a tough battle.[N]
Void goes deeper into Donateenary[AN]
territory. Can she win?[A][X]

## Ch26Ending
[Right][LoadVoid]
We did it. Holy crap, we did it.[A][X]

## Ch27Opening
Void had made it past Darrman's Lakes. All[N]
that remained was one convenient lake. It[AN]
appears another battle awaits Void on this[N]
day.[A][X]

## Ch27Ending
[Right][LoadVoid]
Kirb, why?[A][X]

## Ch28Opening
[OpenRight][LoadKaga]
[OpenLeft][LoadChiki]
Father![A]
[Right]
Tiki, what are you doing here?[A]
[Left]
I got bored of sleeping all the time[N]
and watching my husbandos die, so when[AN]
I heard you were active again, I decided[N]
to seek you out, but I got lost, and then[AN]
someone named Maeda sexualized me, then[N]
some asshat named MC waifued me, then I got[AN]
pulled into some JPop atrocity on a failing[N]
console, then I met two other mes in a[AN]
gacha game, and now I'm a children's toy.[A]
[Right]
(She doesn't need to know I'm actually MC...)[AN]
That's awful my girl, but don't worry about[N]
that anymore, because Daddy is here.[A]
[Left]
You'll allow me to travel with you?[A]
[Right]
Sure, what could possibly go wrong?![A][X]

## Ch28Ending
[Right][LoadVoid]
This is it, the Super Blitz lance...[N]
I can feel the power flowing through[AN]
me. Soon father, mother, sister,[N]
brother, 1st cousin, auntie, uncle[AN]
Jimbob, 2nd cousin......[AN]

Great great great great granuncle[N]
Fondell, I will avenge all of you.[A][X]

## Ch29Ending
[Right][LoadVoid]
That's the end of the Donateenaries...[N]
All that's left now is the Demon King.[A][X]

## TrueEnding
[Left][LoadMC]
[Right][LoadVoid]
What's this place?[A]
[Left]
AHHHHH! You're not supposed to be here yet![A]
[Right]
Who are you?[A]
[Left]
I'm the writer, I wrote this amazing story.[A]
[Right]
So then you're the reason my family is dead?[A]
[Left]
...Shit. Here, have a plot contrivance.[N]
Now they're alive again.[A]
[Right][Smile]
THANKS, bye![N]
What a Blitzarre Adventure.[A][X]

Good news, everyone![N]
We've received advance warning[A][N]

No sign of Veronica.[N]
It looks like we made it in time.[AN]

You know, Eliwood, if you[N]
had told me one year ago[AN]
that we would not only[N]
marry the same woman,[AN]
but also each other,[AN]
I would have punched you[N]
and told you to stop dreaming.[AN]
[MR]
Hector, this is the fiftieth[N]
time you've said that.[A]
[FL]
Ha! The look on those pompous[N]
lords' faces was priceless![AN]
They were so stunned, they[N]
completely forgot to object![AN]
[MR]
And a good thing too, because[N]
with Pherae, Ostia, and Caelin[AN]
combined, we three control Lycia.[AN]
[FL]
The Lycian Triumvirate[Beat][N]
In just a few hours, we shall be wed.[AN]

Lord Eliwood, it warms my heart[N]
to see this day come at last.[AN]
The whole of Lycia[N]
celebrates your union.[AN]
Why, I have just been informed[N]
that we even have some guests[AN]
from a faraway land arriving now.[A]
[ML]
A faraway land[Beat]?[A]
[FR]
They have come all the way[N]
from the kingdom of Askr.[AN]
A surprise, to be sure,[N]
but a welcome one.[A]
[ML]
Thank you, Marcus.[AN]
It is as [Tact] always said,[N]
"anyone with a kind face must[AN]
be treated as a potential[N]
friend and ally".[AN]
Speaking of which[Beat]?[A]
[FR]
[Beat]I am sorry, Lord Eliwood.[N]
There is yet no news of [Tact].[AN]
Perhaps he did not receive[N]
your invitation.[A]
[ML]
I had hoped[Beat][AN]
No matter. [Tact] will always[N]
be with us in spirit.[AN]
This wedding is the result[N]
of what he taught us.[A]

Milord, there's an emergency![AN]
Sir Dorcas just keeled over[N]
at dinner and appears to have died![A]
[FL]
What? When? How?[A]
[MR]
Just now, sir! I ran here as[N]
fast as I could. The men[AN]
say he was poisoned by our[N]
enemies![A]
[Left]
Enemies? This is a wedding.[N]
We are all friends here,[AN]
I know and trust all of you.[A]
[FL]
Begging your pardon, Lord Eliwood,[N]
but that is not entirely accurate.[A]
[Left]
You refer to the newcomers, Marcus?[AN]
It is true that I do not know them well,[N]
but you told me they could be trusted,[AN]
and I trust your judgement.[N]
I also trust in [Tact]'s lessons.[AN]
Surely there is a reasonable[N]
explanation for this.[AN]
Guards, have the intruders[N]
brought to me. We shall see[AN]
what they have to say[N]
for themselves.[A]
[MR][ClearFace][LoadHector]
Wait just a damn second![AN]
Eliwood, you can't be serious.[N]
I know you want to believe in[AN]
[Tact] and his lessons, but look[N]
around you![AN]
If it wasn't these newcomers,[N]
that means one of our own[AN]
is the killer.[A][NN]
Who do you trust more,[N]
our friends and comrades,[AN]
or some strangers who showed[N]
up without even an invitation?[AN]
[MoveRight]
[FR][LoadLyn]
Hector's right, Eliwood.[AN]
I want to trust these people[N]
as much as you do.[AN]
I care about [Tact]'s legacy[N]
just as you do.[AN]
[Tact] taught me that you[N]
never know what someone[AN]
can bring into your life, if[N]
you place your trust in them.[AN]
The two of you taught me[N]
that love can take root[AN]
in the strangest of places.[AN]
And Dorcas taught me that[N]
even an enemy can become[AN]
a staunch friend.[AN]
But [Tact] left us, and now[N]
Dorcas has been murdered.[AN]
Those who sever our[N]
precious bonds will not[AN]
be forgiven.[A]
[Left]
Then I hope we are not[N]
making a grave mistake.[AN]
Guards, arrest the intruders![A]

Only the most terrible disaster[N]

Ah, love, thou art the[N]

This is Lady Lyndis' wedding day.[AN]
Today we are celebrating her union[N]

Ah[Beat][A]

So why are you miserable?[A]

[Beat] Kent. You know as well as I do[N]

Sain, I[Beat][A]

I know you better than anyone,[N]

That's what boon companions[N]

[MR]
Ah[Beat] You are right.[AN]
Tell me something, Sain.[N]
When did you get so wise?[A]
[ML]
The other day I came across[N]
a fair lady, dainty as the[AN]
flowers she was selling,[N]
and twice as pretty.[AN]
I could not let such beauty[N]
go unremarked, so I rode up-[A]
[MR]
I don't need to hear about[N]
yet another one of your[AN]
rejections, Sain.[A]
[ML]
Let me finish, Kent![A][NN]
As I approached, I saw[N]
that she had a familiar[AN]
face. It was Natalie,[N]
the young lady we saved[AN]
from bandits back in Bern.[N]
She told me that she and[AN]
Dorcas were expecting[N]
their first child, and I swear[AN]
to you, Kent, her smile as[N]
she said it increased her[AN]
beauty tenfold.[A]
[MR]
Dorcas is a lucky man indeed.[A]
[ML]
But between having an extra[N]
mouth to feed, and her worsening[AN]
illness, she has taken to flower[N]
selling to ease the burden on[AN]
her husband.[A][NN]
Kent, I know their situation[N]
is difficult. I see the bags[AN]
under Dorcas' eyes growing[N]
day by day. And yet[Beat][AN]
I wish I had what they have.[A]

To- to force us to fight[N]
each other[Beat] right?[A]
[Right]
To prevent the wedding[N]
from going forward?[A]
[ML]
If that were the case, why would the[N]
killer leave so many clues for you?[A]
[FR]
[Beat]without the Turnwheel, we could[N]
never have found the true killer[Beat][A]
[Right]
[Beat]and the killer is the one who[N]
gave the Turnwheel to Dorcas.[A]
[ML]
So. [Red]Why[Red] would the killer[N]
go to such lengths?[AN]
Why make Dorcas eat[N]
so much mutton?[A]
[FR]
Why? Because they're crazy![AN]
What does mutton have to do[N]
with anything?[A]
[Right]
If you know, then tell us![A]
[ML]
I don't know. Not for sure.[N]
But I do know this.[AN]
Whoever did this thinks[N]
that they're invincible.[AN]
This is all just a game to them,[N]
and your lives are the pieces.[A]
[FR]
And now we're going to[N]
face them?[A]
[ML]
Yes. Destroying the Turnwheel[N]
released the magic within.[AN]
That magic is snapping back[N]
and we are caught in the undertow.[AN]
We need only ride it back to its[N]
source to find the true killer.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]Revenge? I cannot say[N]
the thought is unappealing[Beat][AN]
but I wonder what [Tact] would[N]
say to me now.[AN]
Destroying the killer will[N]
not bring them back.[AN]
The turnwheel could have[N]
done that, but now[Beat][A]
[ML]
I will say it once more.[AN]
Nothing good comes[N]
of time travel.[A]
[Right]
[Tact] would say nothing[N]
good comes of revenge.[AN]
But [Tact] is gone, along[N]
with everyone else.[A]
[ML]
[Beat]Let me finish.[AN]
There may be a way[N]
to restore them.[AN]
While you were all busy[N]
fighting, I was watching.[AN]
The Turnwheel was quietly[N]
gathering quintessence.[AN]
By defeating its master,[N]
we will be able to-[A]
[Right]
No. I have seen the 'life'[N]
created by quintessence.[A]
[ML]
You seem to enjoy[N]
interrupting.[AN]
Maybe you can interrupt[N]
Mila from her stony slumber[AN]
and ask her for help.[A]
[FR]
Oh, ha ha. I see you're[N]
still a jerk, Veronica.[AN]
Why ARE you helping us,[N]
anyway?[A]
[ML]
Let's just say-[.4] ah![A][Close]
We're about to arrive![A]
[FR]
Everyone, prepare[N]
for battle![A][X]

##MarkyIntro
[FL][LoadMarkyjoe]
So, you've arrived.[N]
Did you like my little game?[A]
[MR][LoadEliwood]
[Tact]?![AN]
What are you doing here?[A]
[FL]
Oh, don't act so surprised.[N]
As if it wasn't obvious all along.[A]
[MR][MoveRight][FR][LoadAnna]
Who is that?[N]
Do you know him?[A]
[MR][LoadVeronica]
It's him. He's the one.[A]
[Right]
No. I can't believe this.[AN]
You were the one who[N]
taught us trust and love![AN]
Why would you do this?[A]
[FL]
Why? You fool.[AN]
I did that so I could[N]
see your supports![A]
[Right]
My[Beat] what?[A]
[FL]
Did you really think that everyone lived[N]
because my strategies were perfect?[AN]
Ha! I simply used the Turnwheel to go[N]
back each time someone perished.[AN]
I have seen you and your little friends[N]
live, love, and die a thousand times.[A]
[MR]
[Beat][A]
[FL]
Did you know? Being the master[N]
of time itself can be so[Beat]. [Red]dull[Red].[AN]
After a while, I began to test myself.[N]
Trying to feel something, anything.[AN]
I began to seek[Beat] stimulation.[AN]
For years, [Red]rage[Red] has been my[N]
constant companion.[AN]
Rage[Beat]. and memes.[N]
You want to know why Dorcas died?[AN]
[Red]Because it was funny.[Red][A]
[Right]
[Tact][Beat] You've changed.[AN]
Please, I know the old you[N]
is in there somewhere![AN]
Don't you feel anything?[A]
[FR]
Eliwood, it's no use.[N]
He's clearly insane.[A]
[FL]
Insane, am I?[AN]
That may be[Beat] but you[N]
cannot hope to beat me.[AN]
All of this has been a[N]
part of my plan.[A]
[Right]
[Tact][Beat][A][ClearFace]
[LoadSharena]
Wrong![A]
[MR][ClearFace]
[FR][ClearFace][LoadAlfonse]
We're going to take you down, and[N]
you're going to return everyone![A]
[FL]
And what makes you think[N]
that, foolish children?[A]
[Right]
Because we know [Red]what you want.[Red][A]
[FR]
You want to feel alive.[N]
You want to [Red]be challenged.[Red][A]
[Right]
Well, here's a challenge for you![A]
[FR]
One final battle. Us against you.[N]
If we win, you restore everyone.[A]
[FL]
Heh. That won't work.[N]
Those people are dead.[AN]
Even with their quintessence,[N]
I can only make pale copies.[A][Close]
But I must admit, your offer[N]
intrigues me. Very well![AN]
I accept your challenge.[A][Close]
One last battle, a fight[N]
to the death.[AN]
Defeat me, and you shall[N]
have your revenge.[AN]
That much, I can grant you.[A][X]

##MarkyDefeated
[Right][LoadEliwood]
[FR][LoadVeronica]
[MR][LoadAnna]
[ML][LoadMarkyjoe]
Congratulations[Beat] you won.[N]
That was[Beat] some fight.[AN]
Before I go[Beat] [N]
the quintessence.[AN]
Take it.[A]
[MR]
What would we do with it?[A]
[ML]
Who knows?[AN]
With that much power, you[N]
could build a new world[Beat][A]
[Right]
All I want is my friends[N]
and family back.[A]
[ML]
You would need[Beat][AN]
Mila's power for that[Beat][N]
but she is sealed away.[A][Close]
By using up the quintessence,[N]
you'd be able to wake her,[AN]
but that quintessence[N]
is needed to revive them.[A]
[Right]
To save everyone,[N]
I need to wake Mila.[AN]
But if I do that, I[N]
sacrifice my friends?[A]
[ML]
This world is cruel[Beat][N]
I am[Beat] sorry. [CloseEyes]Ah[Beat][A][ClearFace]
[Right]
[Tact]![A]
[X]

##PostDefeat
[FL][LoadVeronica]
[Left][LoadEliwood]
[Right][LoadSharena]
[FR][LoadAlfonse]
There's no way it can end like this![A]
[Left]
I've got it! We just need to[N]
[Red]turn our thinking around[Red] again![A]
[Right]
What do you mean?[A]
[Left]
Instead of wondering how we can[N]
wake Mila and save my friends,[AN]
we should be asking ourselves:[N]
[Red]"Where did Mila's power come from?"[Red][A]
[FR]
Wow! I would never have[N]
thought of that! Why?[A]
[Left]
Well, Mila was a Divine Dragon, right?[N]
But there were other Divine Dragons.[AN]
They didn't have the power to[N]
revive the dead or travel in time.[A]
[Right]
So why was Mila different?[A]
[FR]
Wings for hair?[A]
[Right]
You mean hair for[N]
wings, right?[A]
[FR]
No way! They're obviously-[A]
[FL]
OBJECTION![AN]
Stop interrupting, you[N]
imbeciles. Listen.[A]
[Left]
Don't you see?[AN]
There's a power in this world[N]
even stronger than [Red]rage[Red].[AN]
It's the power that brought[N]
us here, together.[AN]
The catalyst for everything.[N]
The [Red]reason[Red] [Tact] continued to[N]
seek ever greater challenges.[A]
[FR]
What is it?[A]
[Left]
It's[.4] [Red]love[Red].[A]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadAnna]
Please tell me you're joking.[A]
[Left]
I've never been more serious in my life.[N]
Love will save the day. It must![AN]
Mila's love for humanity gave her[N]
the power to defy death itself.[AN]
With the power of the quintessence,[N]
combined with the depth of my love,[AN]
I will bring everyone back and[N]
live with them happily ever after![A]
[Right][Beat][A]
[FR][Beat][A]
[Left]What?[A]
[FR]
That's your solution?[A]
[Right]
The power of love?[A]
[FL]
Do you have any magical aptitude[N]
whatsoever? Any training at all?[A]
[Left]
W-well[Beat][A][Close]
It would make a good[N]
ending, wouldn't it?[AN]
B-besides, I don't suppose[N]
any of you have ideas?[A]
[FL]
[Beat]All right.[AN]
I didn't want to do this, but[N]
it looks like the time has come.[A][Close]
There's something you need[N]
to know about me.[AN]
I am not the Veronica from[N]
your timeline.[A][Close]
In my original world, I arrived[N]
with my army, and destroyed you.[AN]
I took the Turnwheel and[N]
foolishly used it.[AN]
Before I knew it, I was tumbling through[N]
timelines, trying to find my way back.[AN]
I do not know how long I spent like that.[N]
But it was long enough.[AN]
Almost by accident, I gained quintessence.[N]
Over and over, drawing from your deaths.[AN]
When I finally[Beat] broke[Beat] the cycle,[N]
I[Beat] absorbed it.[AN]
Using the shards of the Turnwheel,[N]
I can use that to recreate Mila's power.[A]
[Right][ClearFace][LoadSharena]
You can do that?[A]
[FR]
Why didn't you say so before?[A]
[FL]
There is[Beat] a price.[A]
[Left]
For my loved ones, I will pay it.[N]
Whatever it takes.[A]
[FL]
Idiot. The price is not[N]
for you to pay.[A][Close]
To achieve that power[Beat] I must[N]
combine it with my own quintessence.[A]
[FR]
But that means-[A]
[Right]
-you'll die![A]
[FL]
I will cease to exist.[AN]
Your friends and family[N]
will return to life.[AN]
You will have your[N]
happy ending.[A]
[Left]
Even for my friends[Beat][AN]
Veronica, I cannot ask[N]
you to give up your life.[A]
[FL]
I know. And that is why[N]
I will do it for you.[A][Close]
[CloseEyes]
Only a fool like you could c-[.4]care so[N]
much for someone like[Beat] like me.[AN]
I do not deserve-[.4] I have done[N]
[Beat]terrible things.[AN]
I never belonged in this world.[A]
[Right]
Veronica[Beat][A]
[FL]
[OpenEyes]I have made up my mind.[AN]
The world you want to create[N]
has no place for me.[AN]
This is the least I can do.[A]
[Left]
I[Beat][A]
[FL]
Please,[.4] do not make this[N]
harder than it already is.[A][Close][.4]
Well[Beat] here I go.[A][X]

##VeronicaSacrifice
[SetName]Veronica[N]
O Mother Mila![AN]
I offer up my soul in[N]
exchange for your power![AN]
Grant me the strength[N]
to return these lost souls[AN]
to the realm of the living![A][X]

##EpilogueIntro
[FL][LoadHector]
[Left][LoadLyn]
What happened?[AN]
Was I dreaming?[A]
[FL]
I[Beat] don't know.[A]
[FR][LoadEliwood]
It worked[Beat][A][Close]
[MoveRight]
It worked![A]
[FR][LoadDorcas]
Urg[Beat] I think I ate[N]
too much mutton.[A][X]

##EpilogueIntro2
[Right][LoadSharena]
[FR][LoadAlfonse]
[ML][LoadAnna]
That was[Beat] an[N]
experience.[A]
[Right]
I never thought Veronica-[.4][AN]
Al, are you crying?[A]
[FR]
N-no! I just have[N]
something in my eye.[A]
[ML]
[Beat][AN]
Well, everyone is saved,[N]
and we cleared our names.[AN]
Eliwood will be our ally.[N]
That about wraps it up![A]
[Right]
So why do I feel like[N]
we've forgotten something?[A][X]

##EliwoodAnnouncement
[ML][LoadEliwood]
People of Elibe![A][Close]
I have an important[N]
announcement to make.[AN]
This day was to be the[N]
happiest day of my life.[AN]
Yet events transpired that[N]
threatened to destroy it all.[A][Close]
We stand here today because[N]
of the courage and sacrifice[AN]
shown by someone whom fate[N]
had dealt the bitterest hand.[AN]
She gave her life to give[N]
us a second chance.[A][Close]
I will not squander that gift.[N]
For Veronica,[.4] and for [Tact][Beat][AN]
They showed me what is[N]
truly important in life.[A][Close][.4]
That is why, here and now,[N]
I ask every one of you[Beat][AN]
[Red]to marry me[Red].[A][X]

##EpilogueNarration
And so, the people of Elibe[N]
all married each other[AN]
in the greatest wedding[N]
in all the outrealms,[AN]
and they all lived[N]
happily ever after.[A][X]

##RealVeronicaArrives

[FL][LoadVeronica]
What? The Askrans arrived[N]
before us! Emblian soldiers-[A]
[Event]
[Right][MoveMidLeft]
Veronica! Thank goodness[N]
you're all right![A]
[FL]
Huh?[A]
[FR][MoveLeft]
You had us so worried![A]
[FL]
Huh?[.4] Huh?[A]
[FR][LoadAnna]
Veronica? Oh, you must be[N]
the one from our timeline.[A]
[FL]
Huh?[.4] Huh?[.4] Huh?[A]
[FR][MoveRight][MoveMidLeft]
But even knowing that, I'm[N]
just so happy to see you![A]
[FL]
Huh?[.4] Huh?[.4] Huh?[.4] Huh?[A]

She's going to say it![A]

Just let it out![A]

Not bad, not bad.[N]
Can you handle this?[A][X]

##tDroppedTurnwheel
The Turnwheel was lost.[X]

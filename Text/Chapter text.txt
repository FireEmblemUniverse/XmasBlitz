Good news, everyone![N]
We've received advance warning[A][N]

about to strike once again.[A]

No sign of Veronica.[N]
It looks like we made it in time.[AN]

You know, Eliwood, if you[N]
had told me one year ago[AN]
that we would not only[N]
marry the same woman,[AN]
but also each other,[AN]
I would have punched you[N]
and told you to stop dreaming.[AN]
[MR]
Hector, this is the fiftieth[N]
time you've said that.[A]
[FL]
Ha! The look on those pompous[N]
lords' faces was priceless![AN]
They were so stunned, they[N]
completely forgot to object![AN]
[MR]
And a good thing too, because[N]
with Pherae, Ostia, and Caelin[AN]
combined, we three control Lycia.[AN]
[FL]
The Lycian Triumvirate[Beat][N]
In just a few hours, we shall be wed.[AN]

Our dream will become reality.[AN]

Lord Eliwood, it warms my heart[N]
to see this day come at last.[AN]
The whole of Lycia[N]
celebrates your union.[AN]
Why, I have just been informed[N]
that we even have some guests[AN]
from a faraway land arriving now.[A]
[ML]
A faraway land[Beat]?[A]
[FR]
They have come all the way[N]
from the kingdom of Askr.[AN]
A surprise, to be sure,[N]
but a welcome one.[A]
[ML]
Thank you, Marcus.[AN]
It is as [Tact] always said,[N]
"anyone with a kind face must[AN]
be treated as a potential[N]
friend and ally".[AN]
Speaking of which[Beat]?[A]
[FR]
[Beat]I am sorry, Lord Eliwood.[N]
There is yet no news of [Tact].[AN]
Perhaps he did not receive[N]
your invitation.[A]
[ML]
I had hoped[Beat][AN]
No matter. [Tact] will always[N]
be with us in spirit.[AN]
This wedding is the result[N]
of what he taught us.[A]

Milord, there's an emergency![AN]
Sir Dorcas just keeled over[N]
at dinner and appears to have died![A]
[FL]
What? When? How?[A]
[MR]
Just now, sir! I ran here as[N]
fast as I could. The men[AN]
say he was poisoned by our[N]
enemies![A]
[Left]
Enemies? This is a wedding.[N]
We are all friends here,[AN]
I know and trust all of you.[A]
[FL]
Begging your pardon, Lord Eliwood,[N]
but that is not entirely accurate.[A]
[Left]
You refer to the newcomers, Marcus?[AN]
It is true that I do not know them well,[N]
but you told me they could be trusted,[AN]
and I trust your judgement.[N]
I also trust in [Tact]'s lessons.[AN]
Surely there is a reasonable[N]
explanation for this.[AN]
Guards, have the intruders[N]
brought to me. We shall see[AN]
what they have to say[N]
for themselves.[A]
[MR][ClearFace][LoadHector]
Wait just a damn second![AN]
Eliwood, you can't be serious.[N]
I know you want to believe in[AN]
[Tact] and his lessons, but look[N]
around you![AN]
If it wasn't these newcomers,[N]
that means one of our own[AN]
is the killer.[A][NN]
Who do you trust more,[N]
our friends and comrades,[AN]
or some strangers who showed[N]
up without even an invitation?[AN]
[MoveRight]
[FR][LoadLyn]
Hector's right, Eliwood.[AN]
I want to trust these people[N]
as much as you do.[AN]
I care about [Tact]'s legacy[N]
just as you do.[AN]
[Tact] taught me that you[N]
never know what someone[AN]
can bring into your life, if[N]
you place your trust in them.[AN]
The two of you taught me[N]
that love can take root[AN]
in the strangest of places.[AN]
And Dorcas taught me that[N]
even an enemy can become[AN]
a staunch friend.[AN]
But [Tact] left us, and now[N]
Dorcas has been murdered.[AN]
Those who sever our[N]
precious bonds will not[AN]
be forgiven.[A]
[Left]
Then I hope we are not[N]
making a grave mistake.[AN]
Guards, arrest the intruders![A]

Only the most terrible disaster[N]

Ah, love, thou art the[N]

This is Lady Lyndis' wedding day.[AN]
Today we are celebrating her union[N]

Ah[Beat][A]

So why are you miserable?[A]

[Beat] Kent. You know as well as I do[N]

Sain, I[Beat][A]

I know you better than anyone,[N]

That's what boon companions[N]

[MR]
Ah[Beat] You are right.[AN]
Tell me something, Sain.[N]
When did you get so wise?[A]
[ML]
The other day I came across[N]
a fair lady, dainty as the[AN]
flowers she was selling,[N]
and twice as pretty.[AN]
I could not let such beauty[N]
go unremarked, so I rode up-[A]
[MR]
I don't need to hear about[N]
yet another one of your[AN]
rejections, Sain.[A]
[ML]
Let me finish, Kent![A][NN]
As I approached, I saw[N]
that she had a familiar[AN]
face. It was Natalie,[N]
the young lady we saved[AN]
from bandits back in Bern.[N]
She told me that she and[AN]
Dorcas were expecting[N]
their first child, and I swear[AN]
to you, Kent, her smile as[N]
she said it increased her[AN]
beauty tenfold.[A]
[MR]
Dorcas is a lucky man indeed.[A]
[ML]
But between having an extra[N]
mouth to feed, and her worsening[AN]
illness, she has taken to flower[N]
selling to ease the burden on[AN]
her husband.[A][NN]
Kent, I know their situation[N]
is difficult. I see the bags[AN]
under Dorcas' eyes growing[N]
day by day. And yet[Beat][AN]
I wish I had what they have.[A]

To prevent the wedding[N]
from going forward?[A]
[ML]
If that were the case, why would the[N]
killer leave so many clues for you?[A]
[FR]
[Beat]without the Turnwheel, we could[N]
never have found the true killer[Beat][A]
[Right]
[Beat]and the killer is the one who[N]
gave the Turnwheel to Dorcas.[A]
[ML]
So. [Red]Why[Red] would the killer[N]
go to such lengths?[AN]
Why make Dorcas eat[N]
so much mutton?[A]
[FR]
Why? Because they're crazy![AN]
What does mutton have to do[N]
with anything?[A]
[Right]
If you know, then tell us![A]
[ML]
I don't know. Not for sure.[N]
But I do know this.[AN]
Whoever did this thinks[N]
that they're invincible.[AN]
This is all just a game to them,[N]
and your lives are the pieces.[A]
[FR]
And now we're going to[N]
face them?[A]
[ML]
Yes. Destroying the Turnwheel[N]
released the magic within.[AN]
That magic is snapping back[N]
and we are caught in the undertow.[AN]
We need only ride it back to its[N]
source to find the true killer.[A]
[Right]
[Beat]Revenge? I cannot say[N]
the thought is unappealing[Beat][AN]
but I wonder what [Tact] would[N]
say to me now.[AN]
Destroying the killer will[N]
not bring them back.[AN]
The turnwheel could have[N]
done that, but now[Beat][A]
[ML]
I will say it once more.[AN]
Nothing good comes[N]
of time travel.[A]
[Right]
[Tact] would say nothing[N]
good comes of revenge.[AN]
But [Tact] is gone, along[N]
with everyone else.[A]
[ML]
[Beat]Let me finish.[AN]
There may be a way[N]
to restore them.[AN]
While you were all busy[N]
fighting, I was watching.[AN]
The Turnwheel was quietly[N]
gathering quintessence.[AN]
By defeating its master,[N]
we will be able to-[A]
[Right]
No. I have seen the 'life'[N]
created by quintessence.[A]
[ML]
Then you had best pray[N]
to Mila herself.[AN]
Maybe your prayers can[N]
wake her from stone.[A]
[FR]
Oh, ha ha. I see you're[N]
still a jerk, Veronica.[AN]
Why ARE you helping us,[N]
anyway?[A]
[ML]
Let's just say-[.4] ah![A][Close]
We're about to arrive![A]
[FR]
Everyone, prepare[N]
for battle![A][X]

##MarkyIntro
[ML][LoadMarkyjoe]
So, you've arrived.
This was all part of my game
you thought you were breaking out
but you were my puppet all along

What happened to you

What about love and trust

Lol that was just to get support bonuses
and read characterization
Did you think everyone lived
because of my strategy?
No, I simply rewound time
whenever someone died.
I have seen you all
live, love, and die a thousand deaths
Being the master of time
is so... boring.
So i began to seek ever more
stimulating experiences
For years, rage has been
my constant companion.
You cannot hope to defeat
me, you are just puppets dancing on a string

Wrong.
We're going to take you down
and you're going to return everyone we lost

Ha, and what makes you think that?

Because that's the interesting option.
You want to feel alive, right?

We challenge you. One last battle.
If we beat you, you return everyone.

Fools. Those people are dead. Even with their
quintessence, I can only create copies.
But your offer intrigues me.
I accept your challenge!
I pit my strategic skills against yours.
[breaks turnwheel]
With this, the ending is here.
One last battle, with my very life on the line.
Defeat me, and you will have revenge
for Dorcas and all the others!
[X]

[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
The Demon King killed my family[N]
and took over my country![AN]
To get to him I need[N]
to go through you![A][X]

##Ch3Start
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x4][0x1]
[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]

Those horses don't.[AN]

is looking fancy.[AN]
LEEROY...[A][X]

What's all this racket?[N]
I can't compile my project.[AN]
I've still got some research[N]
on this fair tale's graphic[AN]
compression format, plus I still[N]
need Boo's script. Who are you?[AN]
You're fighting against the Demon[N]

Idiotic Jenkins. I, Leeroy,[N]
am the only person able to[AN]
charge in without care![N]
Your weapon is now mine.[AN]
[MidRight]
You should be more careful.[N]
Horseslayers, knight killers,[AN]
ridersbanes, beast killers,[N]
halberds, poleaxes, and more[AN]
cause lots of trouble for you.[N]
No matter. Onwards we go![A][X]

you and add my bow to this cause.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You would help us? Really?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Of course. I hate the Demon King[N]
as much as you do. I wish to have[AN]
a hand in bringing about his end.[AN]

[MR][LoadKent]
[ML][LoadSain]
Kent! Kent, my boon companion![AN]
My truest friend! You must join me[N]
in commiseration![A]
[MR]
What are you rambling about now, Sain?[A]
[ML]
Only the most terrible disaster[N]
that has befallen us both![AN]
Ah, love, thou art the[N]
sweetest suffering[Beat][A]
[MR]
This is Lady Lyndis' wedding day.[AN]
Today we are celebrating her union[N]
with the Lords Eliwood and Hector-[A]
[ML]
And celebrate we will, most raucously,[AN]
with lovely ladies aplenty, the very air[N]
thick with romance and possibility[Beat][AN]
Ah[Beat][A]
[MR]
So why are you miserable?[A]
[ML]
[Beat] Kent. You know as well as I do[N]
that both of us harbour feelings[AN]
for Lady Lyndis that go beyond[N]
a knight's loyalty to his liege.[A]
[MR]
Sain, I[Beat][A]
[ML]
I know you better than anyone,[N]
so don't try to deny it.[AN]
And this wedding's got everyone[N]
thinking about what love means.[AN]
But if we're going to mope,[N]
then we mope together.[AN]
That's what boon companions[N]
are for.[A]
[MR]
Ah[Beat] You are right.[AN]
Tell me something, Sain.[N]
When did you get so wise?[A]
[ML]
The other day I came across[N]
a fair lady, dainty as the[AN]
flowers she was selling,[N]
and twice as pretty.[AN]
I could not let such beauty[N]
go unremarked, so I rode up-[A]
[MR]
I don't need to hear about[N]
yet another one of your[AN]
rejections, Sain.[A]
[ML]
Let me finish, Kent![A][NN]
As I approached, I saw[N]
that she had a familiar[AN]
face. It was Natalie,[N]
the young lady we saved[AN]
from bandits back in Bern.[N]
She told me that she and[AN]
Dorcas were expecting[N]
their first child, and I swear[AN]
to you, Kent, her smile as[N]
she said it increased her[AN]
beauty tenfold.[A]
[MR]
Dorcas is a lucky man indeed.[A]
[ML]
But between having an extra[N]
mouth to feed, and her worsening[AN]
illness, she has taken to flower[N]
selling to ease the burden on[AN]
her husband.[A][NN]
Kent, I know their situation[N]
is difficult. I see the bags[AN]
under Dorcas' eyes growing[N]
day by day. And yet[Beat][AN]
I wish I had what they have.[A]
[MR]
So do I, Sain.[A][NN]
So do I.[A]

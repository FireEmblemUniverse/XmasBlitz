[ML][LoadMaeda]
So you've all arrived here in[N]
my castle. Before I strike[AN]
you down, I shall tell you a[N]
story. After I exiled Kaga,[AN]
I rose up the ranks and became[N]
the director of Fire Emblem.[AN]
The series is printing money,[N]
as Kusakihara and I can prove.[AN]
Yes, you may detest Tharja and[N]
Peri, and you may be sickened[AN]
by Camilla's sheer fanservice.[N]
But the series would have died[AN]
otherwise! Do you really think[N]
that would be the right thing[AN]
to do? ...You'd rather Fire[N]
Emblem have died with "dignity"[AN]
instead of bringing in success?[N]
Very well. En garde![AN][X]

How the heck did you let lowkey the[N]
best mage in the game die? I have never[N]
fucking seen such incompentent fucking[N]
playing in my entire life. I'd tell you[N]
to git gud scrub, but that would at least[N] imply you were half assing this. This is[N]
no assed, absolutely zero asses were put[N]
into your playing skill. Just watch, here[N]
I am slowly bleeding to death because you[N]
were bad at math. How fucking terrible are[N]
you at Fire Emblem anyway? Jeez...[CloseEyes][X]

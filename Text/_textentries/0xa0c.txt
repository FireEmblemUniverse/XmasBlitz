Hee hee![AN]
This time I'll definitely[N]
sneak past Lowen![AN]
I was so sure my [Red]magic[N]
panties[Red] would distract him[Beat][AN]
I should have known that[N]
being unable to see would[AN]
have sharpened his senses.[N]
But he'll never expect me to[AN]
use Jaffar's super-secret[N]
silent sneaky stealth[AN]
skills to get past him![A][Close]
Oh, hi Dorcas-[A]
[FFR][LoadDorcas][MoveFarFarLeft]
[ML][MoveFarLeft]
Ah![.4] Ow[Beat][A]
[MR][LoadJaffar]
[Beat]Did he hurt you?[A]
[FL]
I think my ankle is sprained,[N]
but I'll be okay.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Go to the infirmary.[N]
I will deal with him[Beat][A]
[FL]
Jaffar, no! You told me you'd[N]
stop assassinating people.[AN]
Remember how [Tact] and Lyn[N]
and everyone gave us their[AN]
trust, even though we were[N]
Black Fang![AN]
[MR]
[Beat]He hurt you.[N]
[Beat]I will[Beat] consider it.[AN]
But first, I will take[N]
you to the infirmary.[A]
[FL]
I can take care of myself![A][Close]
But[Beat] Thanks, Jaffar.[A][ClearFace]
[MR]
[Beat]Panties?[AN]
I don't[Beat] understand magic.[A]

Ah, Doowile. It's been a long time.[N]
I see you're a zombie now. How did[AN]
that happen? Some plagues happen when[N]
I was gone, or did you get cursed?[AN]
[Left]
'Twas Maeda, I tell ya. That darn[N]
Maeda. One day yer mindin' your[AN]
own business trying to keep the[N]
place in a decent state, and all[AN]
of a sudden you get zapped by some[N]
witch or another, Thorp I think,[AN]
and my flesh clean vanished. Dang.[AN]
[Right]
Don't worry. Maeda's been taken[N]
of, so you could join me now.[A]
[Left]
I suppose that's a decent plan. But[N]
we gotta take care of Bones first![A][X]

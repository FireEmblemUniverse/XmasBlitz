That was... surprising.[A]
[FL]
Indeed, let us be more[N]
careful in the future.[AN]
[MR]
Right. But how did the Donateenaries[N]
change the weather, though?[AN]
[Left]
I assume it must be the unholy[N]
tome Naglfar, said to be the[AN]
by-product of some unholy demon[N]
known as FEditor, now known as[AN]
the Demon King. FEditor gave the[N]
tome of Naglfar to the unholy[AN]
bloodline of his evil god Hex[N]
in order to protect their followers.[AN]
[MR]
So the Demon King merely[N]
serves Hex then?[AN]
[Left]
Yes, the Demon King is more akin[N]
to an angel than a demon, an[AN]
eternal servant to the evil god.[N]
The very same god vanquished[AN]
by the great gods, the league of FEU.[AN]
[MR]
The league of FEU. My family[N]
told me about them before...[AN]
[Left]
Yes, the League of FEU. It is[N]
said you descend from one of[AN]
the League's Gods, and as such[N]
you can wield the fabled[AN]
Super Blitz Lance.[AN]
[MR]
The holy weapon of the League[N]
God Babby, the Super Blitz...[AN]
[Left]
Void, it is your duty to prevent the Demon[N]
King from reviving the Evil God Hex.[AN][X]

Bonjour, madame. Ca va?[A]
[Right]
Uh, excuse me? I don't understand[N]
a single word you're saying.[A]
[Left]
Ah, my name is Bjorn, and I happen[N]
to study as a linguist... That's[AN]
besides the point. In this shrine,[N]
the Donateenaries have one of their[AN]
strongest generals; Banana. If left[N]
unchecked, Banana will cause ruin.[AN]
I can't join you yet, but once Banana[N]
falls, that might change. Bonne chance,[AN]
Void. Take this elixir before you go.[AN][X]

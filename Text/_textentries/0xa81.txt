Those soldiers in dancer's attire[N]
certainly weren't Donateenaries...[AN]
[Left]
Indeed, I wonder who they are with?[AN]
[MR]
Good question, they seemed even[N]
angrier than the Donateenaries.[AN]
[FL]
I've been asking around lately, and[N]
I believe they are part of Maeda's[AN]
army. As I'm sure you know, Maeda[N]
attacked Kaga's homeland, Akaneia,[AN]
and forced him to flee the realm.[N]
Now he has built his castle and[AN]
is trying to destroy Fire Emblem[N]
and everything it stands for,[AN]
and destroy his holy bloodline[N]
while he's at it. He is not a[AN]
servant of Hex, but a man of his own[N]
will. We must save Akaneia from him![AN]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadKaga]
HELP![A]
[MR]
A call for help. Protagonist contract[N]
states I must answer that call for help.[AN]
ONWARD![A][X]

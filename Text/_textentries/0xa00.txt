Lord Eliwood, it warms my heart[N]
to see this day come at last.[AN]
The whole of Lycia[N]
celebrates your union.[AN]
Why, I have just been informed[N]
that we even have some guests[AN]
from a faraway land arriving now.[A]
[ML]
A faraway land...?[A]
[FR]
They have come all the way[N]
from the kingdom of Askr.[AN]
A surprise, to be sure,[N]
but a welcome one.[A]
[ML]
Thank you, Marcus.[AN]
It is as [Tact] always said,[N]
"anyone with a kind face must[AN]
be treated as a potential[N]
friend and ally".[AN]
Speaking of which[Beat]?[A]
[FR]
[Beat]I am sorry, Lord Eliwood.[N]
There is yet no news of [Tact].[AN]
Perhaps he did not receive[N]
your invitation.[A]
[ML]
I had hoped[Beat][AN]
No matter. [Tact] will always[N]
be with us in spirit.[AN]
This wedding is the result[N]
of what he taught us.[A]

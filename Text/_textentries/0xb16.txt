[ML][LoadMrBones]
Ah, the leader of the zombie[N]
colony has come to face me.[AN]
RATTLE! I've got a bone to[N]
pick with you. Always causing[AN]
a fit and bringing your flesh[N]
into my land. Decaying flesh,[AN]
to boot! I'm sick of dealing[N]
with you! Get outta here![AN]
[Clear]
[MR][LoadDoowile]
*moan* Your skeleton colony[N]
is always making life a misery.[AN]
Just tossing broken bones at[N]
us all the time like it's[AN]
absolutely nothin'! Then dogs[N]
always show up and eat us for[AN]
dinner! I ain't dealing with[N]
you darn skeletons no more![AN][X]

[Right]
What is this place?[A]
[Left]
This is the Fort of Bad, a simple stronghold,[N]
but a place more frightening than Hell[AN]
itself for the people living[N]
in the nearby Port of Bad.[AN]
[Right]
Why?[A]
[Left]
The Donateenaries occupy this fortress.[N]
I've heard tell they force the people[AN]
here to make massive donations to Hex.[N]
The town's nearly starved from this abuse.[A]
[Right]
That's... horrid. We must[N]
retake this fortress at once![A]
[Left]
Very well, I will give the order.[A][X]

You know, Eliwood, if you[N]
had told me one year ago[AN]
that we would not only[N]
marry the same woman,[AN]
but also each other,[AN]
I would have punched you[N]
and told you to stop dreaming.[AN]
[MR]
Hector, this is the fiftieth[N]
time you've said that.[A]
[FL]
Ha! The look on those pompous[N]
lords' faces was priceless![AN]
They were so stunned, they[N]
completely forgot to object![AN]
[MR]
And a good thing too, because[N]
with Pherae, Ostia, and Caelin[AN]
combined, we three control Lycia.[AN]
[FL]
The Lycian Triumvirate[Beat][N]
In just a few hours, we shall be wed.[AN]
[Left]
Our dream will become reality.[AN]
[MR]
Our dream[Beat] And [Tact]'s, too.[N]
Come, let us join the festivities.[A]

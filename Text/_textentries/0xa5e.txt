Alright. Now that those mooks are dealt[N]
with, let us kill the Demon King.[AN]
[Left]
No, Void. There's still[N]
29 chapters of mooks to go.[AN]
[Right]
WHAT?! I want to kill[N]
the Demon King now.[A]
[Left]
Unfortunately, that is presently[N]
not possible. When the Demon King[AN]
killed your father, he took the only[N]
weapon able to kill him, the Super[AN]
Blitz. I hazard a guess it'll take[N]
roughly a full fan hack to re-obtain[AN]
it so we can actually kill the Demon King.[AN]
[Right]
Leeroy, sometimes I hate you.[A]
[Left]
It's part of the job, Void.[A][X]

"You are the ocean's gray waves..."[N]
Lost in Thoughts All Alone, the anthem[AN]
of Nolore. They seem to play it all[N]

My name is Celicia. I'm a wandering[AN]
mage, exploring this desert. Are you[N]
here fighting these bandits in the fog?[AN]
Don't worry. My horse is not slowed down[N]
by the desert sands, so I won't be left[AN]
behind. My magic is quite powerful, so[N]
these bandits shouldn't last very long.[AN]
[Right]
Is it just me, or do you look like-[A]

Princess Anteze of Sofia? Yeah, I hear[N]
that a lot. Why does it matter, anyway?[A][X]

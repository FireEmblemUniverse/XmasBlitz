[MidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Phew. That was a tough battle.[N]
But we got through it all the same.[AN]
Alright everyone, it's time to go.[N]
The Demon King won't slay himself![AN]
[MidRight][LoadFace][0x16][0x1]
You're going to slay the Demon King?[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Samson? Ah, yes. That is the plan.[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
I see. In that case, allow me to join[N]
you and add my bow to this cause.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
You would help us? Really?[AN]
[OpenMidRight]
Of course. I hate the Demon King[N]
as much as you do. I wish to have[AN]
a hand in bringing about his end.[AN]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, I don't see why not.[N]
Welcome aboard, Samson![A][X]

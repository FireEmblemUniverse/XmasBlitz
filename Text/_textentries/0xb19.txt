[ML][LoadWendy]
I always told you I'd become a[N]
good unit, Evil Florina. Look[AN]
who's a powerful great knight,[N]
and then look at the weak[AN]
shaman. I was once weak and[N]
scorned. But now I am strong.[AN]
You can become strong too,[N]
if you follow me. It's a[AN]
long road, but it's possible.[AN]

[MR][LoadFlorina]
You've well and truly lost it,[N]
haven't you? Completely lost it.[AN]
I've paid some mercenaries well[N]
to finish this battle, so that[AN]
means your days are numbered.[N]
So long, Gwendolyn. It was fun.[AN][X]

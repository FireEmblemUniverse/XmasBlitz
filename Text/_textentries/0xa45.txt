Hey, you there! Do you know[N]
know Tim and Tam? I hate them.[AN]
I am their archenemy! And some[N]
day, I will prove myself the[AN]
strongest armour knight there[N]
is in the world! What fools they[AN]
are to become fighters. And I[N]
thought Tam was going to be a[AN]
shaman and Timathan something[N]
interesting, but no. Boring[AN]
fighters. Allow me to travel[N]
with you, so I can one-up them.[AN][X]

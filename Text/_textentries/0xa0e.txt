"My darling Natalie,[A][NN]
"If you are reading this, it means[N]
that I have gone where you[AN]
cannot follow.[A][NN]
"For your safety, I will not go[N]
into detail, but know this:[AN]
Everything I do, everything[N]
I have done, was for you.[AN]
For our family.[A][NN]
"If you were here, you would[N]
call me a fool for making you[AN]
worry. If I could, I would tear[N]
up this contract, return home[AN]
with you, and never leave you[N]
again.[A][NN]
"But you know as well as I do[N]
the risks of the childbed. The[AN]
healers have told me that I[N]
may have to choose between[AN]
saving you or the child.[A][NN]
"I choose neither. I have put my[N]
life on the line gladly, because[AN]
it means that both you and our[N]
child will live.[A][NN]
"I have made arrangements[N]
that will ensure you and our[AN]
child shall never want for money.[A][NN]
"You will be able to see the[N]
finest healers in the land to[AN]
treat your illness. I need you[N]
to be there for our child,[AN]
in case I cannot be.[A][NN]
"I love you, now and always.[AN]
Eternally yours,[N]
Dorcas"[A][X]

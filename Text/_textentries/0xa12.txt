[ML][LoadEliwood][Right][LoadSharena][FR][LoadAlfonse]
Please, you have to hear us out![A]
[Right]
We didn't kill that man,[N]
and we can prove it![AN]
[FR]
Just take a look at this magic turnwheel![N]
It contains a message from the [Red]true killer[Red]![A]
[ML]
... I see.[AN]
Tell me something,[N]
strangers.[AN]
What am I supposed[N]
to do now?[AN]
In case you hadn't noticed,[AN]
EVERYONE I EVER CARED[N]
ABOUT IS DEAD![A]
[Right]
Yeah, um, about that...[A]
[FR]
It was self-defense?[A]
[ML]
.............[A]
[FR]
I wish...[AN]
I wish we could go back[N]
and fix it. Believe me.[AN]
But all we can do is[N]
keep moving forward.[A]
[ML]
Moving... forward.[N]
[Tact]... what would you do?[AN]
[Right]
Wait... the Turnwheel is glowing.[N]
Could there be another crystal?[A]
[FR]
Maybe this one will explain who[N]
the true killer really is![A]
[ML]
Enough! I have heard enough.[N]
Just- just go. Leave me be.[A]
[Right]
But- the Emblian Empire could[N]
be here at any minute![A]
[FR]
They'll enslave you and force[N]
you to fight us![A]
[ML]
Look around you. Nobody is left to enslave.[N]
If [Tact] were here, we might have stood[AN]
a chance. He always managed to keep[N]
everyone alive against all odds.[AN]
But without him... without everyone...[N]
what use would anyone have for us?[A]
[FR]
Then let us see what the[N]
final crystal contains.[AN]
Don't you want to know[N]
who the true killer is?[A]
[ML]
I want a great many things.[N]
Can you return them to me?[AN]
[Right]
We-[A]
[ML]
Fine. It is here.[N]
Take it.[A]
[FR]
Your friends will be avenged,[N]
we swear it-[A]
[Right]
Huh? This crystal...[N]
There's no memory in it![A]
[FR]
What do you mean?[A]
[ML][MoveFarLeft]
[Left][LoadAnna]
Let me see that.[A]
[Right]
Wha- Commander![A]
[Left]
Fascinating... It appears[N]
that this was the final piece.[A]
[FR]
Final piece of what?[A]
[Left]
Mila's Turnwheel, of course.[AN]
With this, we can use it for its[N]
true purpose: [Red]turning back time[Red].[A]
[FL]
Don't be ridiculous.[N]
Such a power is impossible.[A]
[Left]
It's said that Mila was so powerful, so wise,[N]
that she could even bring back the dead.[AN]
To reverse time would be no more than[N]
a parlour trick for her.[A]
[Right]
That means...![A]
[FR]
If we use this power-[A]
[Right]
-we can bring everyone back![A]
[FL]
Can this truly be?[N]
Is this some trick?[A]
[Left]
No tricks here, I promise.[N]
Besides, we have to try...[A]

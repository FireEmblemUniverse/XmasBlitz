[ML]Brace yourselves.[N]
We're about to arrive.[A]
[Right]Arrive where? You haven't[N]
told us anything![A]
[FR]What did you mean before,[N]
about asking the wrong questions?[A]
[ML]
It's very simple.[AN]
Tell me, [Red]why[Red][N] was
Dorcas killed?[A]
[FR]
To- to force us to fight[N]
each other... right?[A]
[Right]
To prevent the wedding[N]
from going forward?[A]
[ML]
If that were the case, why would the[N]
killer leave so many clues for you?[A]
[FR]
...without the Turnwheel, we could[N]
never have found the true killer...[A]
[Right]
...and the killer is the one who[N]
gave the Turnwheel to Dorcas.[A]
[ML]
So. [Red]Why[Red] would the killer[N]
go to such lengths?[AN]
Why make Dorcas eat[N]
so much mutton?[A]
[FR]
Why? Because they're crazy![AN]
What does mutton have to do[N]
with anything?[A]
[Right]
If you know, then tell us![A]
[ML]
I don't know. Not for sure.[N]
But I do know this.[AN]
Whoever did this thinks[N]
that they're invincible.[AN]
This is all just a game to them,[N]
and your lives are the pieces.[A]
[FR]
And now we're going to[N]
face them?[A]
[ML]
Yes. Destroying the Turnwheel[N]
released the magic within.[AN]
That magic is snapping back[N]
and we are caught in the undertow.[AN]
We need only ride it back to its[N]
source to find the true killer.[A]
[Right]
...Revenge? I cannot say[N]
the thought is unappealing...[AN]
but I wonder what [Tact] would[N]
say to me now.[AN]
Destroying the killer will[N]
not bring them back.[AN]
The turnwheel could have[N]
done that, but now...[A]
[ML]
I will say it once more.[AN]
Nothing good comes[N]
of time travel.[A]
[Right]
[Tact] would say nothing[N]
good comes of revenge.[AN]
But [Tact] is gone, along[N]
with everyone else.[A]
[ML]
...Let me finish.[AN]
There may be a way[N]
to restore them.[AN]
While you were all busy[N]
fighting, I was watching.[AN]
The Turnwheel was quietly[N]
gathering quintessence.[AN]
By defeating its master,[N]
we will be able to-[A]
[Right]
No. I have seen the 'life'[N]
created by quintessence.[A]
[ML]
Then you had best pray[N]
to Mila herself.[AN]
Maybe your prayers can[N]
wake her from stone.[A]
[FR]
Oh, ha ha. I see you're[N]
still a jerk, Veronica.[AN]
Why ARE you helping us,[N]
anyway?[A]
[ML]
Let's just say-[.4] ah![A][Close]
We're about to arrive![A]
[FR]
Everyone, prepare[N]
for battle![A][X]

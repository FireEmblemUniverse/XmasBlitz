Milord, there's an emergency![AN]
Sir Dorcas just keeled over[N]
at dinner and appears to have died![A]
[FL]
What? When? How?[A]
[MR]
Just now, sir! I ran here as[N]
fast as I could. The men[AN]
say he was poisoned by our[N]
enemies![A]
[Left]
Enemies? This is a wedding.[N]
We are all friends here,[AN]
I know and trust all of you.[A]
[FL]
Begging your pardon, Lord Eliwood,[N]
but that is not entirely accurate.[A]
[Left]
You refer to the newcomers, Marcus?[AN]
It is true that I do not know them well,[N]
but you told me they could be trusted,[AN]
and I trust your judgement.[N]
I also trust in [Tact]'s lessons.[AN]
Surely there is a reasonable[N]
explanation for this.[AN]
Guards, have the intruders[N]
brought to me. We shall see[AN]
what they have to say[N]
for themselves.[A]
[MR][ClearFace][LoadHector]
Wait just a damn second![AN]
Eliwood, you can't be serious.[N]
I know you want to believe in[AN]
[Tact] and his lessons, but look[N]
around you![AN]
If it wasn't these newcomers,[N]
that means one of our own[AN]
is the killer.[A][NN]
Who do you trust more,[N]
our friends and comrades,[AN]
or some strangers who showed[N]
up without even an invitation?[AN]
[MoveRight]
[FR][LoadLyn]
Hector's right, Eliwood.[AN]
I want to trust these people[N]
as much as you do.[AN]
I care about [Tact]'s legacy[N]
just as you do.[AN]
[Tact] taught me that you[N]
never know what someone[AN]
can bring into your life, if[N]
you place your trust in them.[AN]
The two of you taught me[N]
that love can take root[AN]
in the strangest of places.[AN]
And Dorcas taught me that[N]
even an enemy can become[AN]
a staunch friend.[AN]
But [Tact] left us, and now[N]
Dorcas has been murdered.[AN]
Those who sever our[N]
precious bonds will not[AN]
be forgiven.[A]
[Left]
Then I hope we are not[N]
making a grave mistake.[AN]
Guards, arrest the intruders![A]
